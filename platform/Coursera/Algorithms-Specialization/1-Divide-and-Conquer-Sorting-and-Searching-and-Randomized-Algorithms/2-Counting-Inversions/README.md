# Counting Inversions

__Complexity Analysis__:

* Time complexity: _O(n log<sub>2</sub> n)_.
* Space complexity: _O(n)_.

## Programming Assignment #2

This file contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and _100,000_
(inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated.

Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given,
where the _i<sup>th</sup>_ row of the file indicates
the _i<sup>th</sup>_ entry of an array.

Because of the large size of this array, you should implement the fast
_divide-and-conquer_ algorithm covered in the video lectures.
